# Reown AppKit Example (next.js with App Router)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This repository contains examples of using Reown AppKit to connect to blockchains such as EVM, Solana, and Bitcoin.
Each example demonstrates customization of the wallet connect button, specifically focusing on modifying the display
rather than using the built-in components from AppKit.

## Usage

1. Go to Reown Cloud and create a new project.
2. Copy your `Project ID`
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and paste your `Project ID` as the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`
4. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
5. Run `yarn run dev` to start the development server
